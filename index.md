## About Me

I am a PhD student at the University of Melbourne, working primarily with [Susan
Wei](https://www.suswei.com/). My primary interests lie in developing methods to
train probabilistic or Bayesian models, and studying neural networks through the
lens of Bayesian statistics. I am a statistician by training, having completed
my undergraduate and MPhil studies at the University of Western Australia.

Prior to my PhD, I held a statistician/data scientist position (which I still
maintain part-time) at the Department of Primary Industries and Regional
Development in Western Australia.


## Research Interest

### Singular learning theory (SLT)
SLT combines Bayesian statistics and algebraic geometry to study the properties
of singular models, such as neural networks and mixture models; see
[here](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xRWsfGfvDAjRWXcnG/dslt-0-distilling-singular-learning-theory)
and
[here](https://sites.google.com/view/sumiowatanabe/home/singular-learning-theory)
for an introduction. Unfortunately, my lack of knowledge in algebraic geometry
prevents me from contributing to its theoretical development. Instead, I focus
on seeking useful tools in SLT and incorporating them into the training workflow
for modern deep learning. This endeavor proves to be quite challenging too,
especially when dealing with modern networks that are operating in the
interpolating regime (number of parameters > data size). This is because most of
the key results in SLT only work in the asymptotic regime (data size >> number
of parameters).


### Computing Bayesian posteriors
I am always searching for tools that can reliably compute/approximate
posteriors, particularly for multimodal or very high-dimensional distributions.
Lately, I have been studying Langevin-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo and
variational Bayes methods.
