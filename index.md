## About Me

I am a PhD student at the University of Melbourne working primarily with [Susan
Wei](https://www.suswei.com/). My interests lie in developing principled
approaches for training probabilistic models and understanding the mechanisms
behind the success of deep learning. I come from a statistical background,
having completed my undergraduate and MPhil studies at the University of Western
Australia.


Prior to my PhD, I held a data scientist position (which I still maintain
part-time) at the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development,
Western Australia. There, I participated in several interesting projects,
including the prediction of [cereal flowering dates](https://fp.dpird.app/).


## Research Interest

### Singular learning theory (SLT)
SLT combines Bayesian statistics and algebraic geometry to study the properties
of singular models (roughly speaking, unidentifiable models such as neural
networks), see
[here](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xRWsfGfvDAjRWXcnG/dslt-0-distilling-singular-learning-theory)
and
[here](https://sites.google.com/view/sumiowatanabe/home/singular-learning-theory)
for a better introduction. Unfortunately, my lack of knowledge in algebraic
geometry prevents me from contributing to its theoretical development. Rather, I am
looking for useful tools in SLT and try to incorporate them into training
workflow for modern deep learning. This turns out to be quite challenging too,
in particular when dealing with modern networks that are operating in the
interpolating regime as most of the key results in SLT assumes the data size
to be much greater than the model size. Modifications are required.


### Bayesian inference algorithms
Including, but not limited to, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, Stochastic-Gradient
Markov Chain Monte Carlo and variational Bayes. Bayesian neural networks are
theoretical appealing, but practically impossible (or wasteful) to scale to
large and deep networks. My dream is to make this a reality.

## Miscellaneous
* My surname "Ng" is pronounced as *ung* without the vowel sound. It's the
Hokkien (a Chinese dialect) pronunciation of é»„, which stands for *yellow* in
English.
