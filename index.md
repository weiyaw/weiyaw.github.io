## About Me

I am pursuing a PhD in statistical machine learning at the University of
Melbourne with [Susan Wei](https://www.suswei.com/) and [Mingming
Gong](https://mingming-gong.github.io/). I am also working part-time as a
research data scientist at the Department of Primary Industries and Regional
Development, Western Australia. Previously, I completed a Master of Philosophy
in statistics at The University of Western Australia under the supervision of
[Berwin Turlach](https://staffhome.ecm.uwa.edu.au/~00043886/) and [Kevin
Murray](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/kevin-murray).

I grew up in Malaysia and moved to Australia when I started university
in 2013. I speak Mandarin as well! My surname "Ng" is pronounced as *ung*
without the vowel sound. It's the Hokkien (a Chinese dialect) pronunciation of
é»„, which stands for *yellow* in English.

This website is build with [Call me
Sam](https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-sam), a theme for Hugo.
